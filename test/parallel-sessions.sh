# UNPORTED/DEFERRED: copied baseline from Phase 0A for local stack shape only.
# This still validates Anthropic-shaped behavior and is not Coditor validation.
#
# Regression test: parallel Claude sessions from the same working directory
# must produce distinct server-side session ids.
#
# Pre-change, sys_prompt_hash was derived from working_directory only, so
# N parallel sessions collapsed into 1 session_id — their tool events were
# intermixed under one tag, costs were misattributed, and an inactivity
# sweep on the shared session caused other still-running sessions to appear
# to "disappear" from the watch stream.
#
# This test fires N parallel requests with different first-user-message
# content and asserts that the docker logs show N distinct sys_prompt_hash
# values. It does NOT require real Anthropic credentials — the proxy logs
# the hash during request_body phase before the upstream call is made.
#
# Usage: ./test/parallel-sessions.sh [N]
